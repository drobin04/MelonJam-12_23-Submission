/// @description Insert description here
// You can write your code in this editor

depth = -10;

// For the game section there will be a zombie that you have to kill

// Amusingly, maybe the zombie appears in the center of the options dialog and then walks off

// You are presented with some tools on the options screen when this happens

// You have to identify the right tool to kill the zombie

// One can be a gun.

// Equipping the gun (left click on it, it will be an object) gives you the shooting mouse cursor

// It takes 5 shots to kill the zombie

// Otherwise, equip the sword and drag the mouse through the zombie 3x

// Need an animation for the zombie getting hacked up

// A 3rd Charm option would be neat. Hover mouse on top of zombie, fill up a progress bar above its head
// After 3 seconds it completes and the zombie is charmed

// Show dialog telling the user "Aaahhhh!! A zombie!! Kill it! Grab that sword (Click!) And then slice! Slice him up good!!
